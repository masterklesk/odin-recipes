    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (3.5 ounce) package cook and serve butterscotch pudding mix</li>
        <li>½ cup butter</li>
        <li>½ cup packed brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons ground ginger</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a medium bowl, cream together the dry butterscotch pudding mix, butter, and brown sugar until smooth. Stir in the egg. Combine the flour, baking soda, ginger, and cinnamon; stir into the pudding mixture. Cover, and chill dough until firm, about 1 hour. </li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease baking sheets. On a floured board, roll dough out to about 1/8 inch thickness, and cut into man shapes using a cookie cutter. Place cookies 2 inches apart on the prepared baking sheets. </li>
        <li>Bake for 10 to 12 minutes in the preheated oven, until cookies are golden at the edges. Cool on wire racks. </li>
